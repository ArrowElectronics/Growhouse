The RTX_Traffic project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the NXP 'LPC1768' microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1700' 
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V3.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 400 MHz
   - CCLK  = 100 MHz

Traffic is a program that controls a traffic light.

The traffic light is timed and lets cars pass during a
specific time period.  There is a pedestrial crossing button (INT0)
that lets pedestrians cross.  

There are several things of interest here:

*  This program uses RTX Kernel

*  UART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Traffic program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:     configured for software Simulator

  LPC1768 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
