// A library's status is an 8-bit value with information about it.
// The high bit indicates whether the library is present (1), or if it is a
// stub (0).  The lower 7-bits can be used for codes specific to the library.
// This allows a library, like the security library, to specify what additional
// features are present.
// A value of 0xFF is reserved, it indicates an error in retrieving the
// library status.
