/**
 * @addtogroup event
 *
 * These macros implement an event abstraction that allows the application
 * to schedule code to run after some specified time interval. An event
 * consists of a procedure to be called at some point in the future and
 * a control object that determines when the procedure should be called. Events
 * are also useful for when an ISR needs to initiate an action that should
 * run outside of ISR context.
 *
 * See event.h for source code.
 *
 * Note that while not required, it is recommended that the event-handling procedure
 * explicitly defines the recurrence of the next event, either by rescheduling
 * it via some kind of @e emberEventControlSetDelayXX() call or by deactivating it
 * via a call to ::emberEventControlSetInactive().
 * In cases where the handler does not explicitly reschedule or cancel the
 * event, the default behavior of the event control system is to keep the
 * event immediately active as if the handler function had called
 * ::emberEventControlSetActive(someEvent) or
 * ::emberEventControlSetDelayMS(someEvent, 0)
 *
 * The base time units for events are ticks. Each tick is approximately equal
 * to a millisecond, but the true duration depends on the platform. The
 * duration of a tick is 1000 / ::MILLISECOND_TICKS_PER_SECOND, where 1000 is
 * the number of milliseconds per second and ::MILLISECOND_TICKS_PER_SECOND is
 * the platform-specific number of ticks per second. For example,
 * ::MILLISECOND_TICKS_PER_SECOND on the EM357 SoC is 1024, so each tick is
 * therefore 1000 / 1024 = ~0.98 milliseconds. Calling
 * ::emberEventControlSetDelayMS(someEvent, 100) on the EM357 SoC will schedule
 * the event for 100 ticks * (1000 milliseconds / 1024 ticks) =
 * ~97.7 milliseconds. Note however that the accuracy of the base tick depends
 * on the timer source. Further, the scheduled delay is the minimum delay.
 * If ::emberRunEvents or ::emberRunTask are not called frequently enough, the
 * actual delay may be longer than the scheduled delay.
 *
 * Additionally, the APIs for quarter second and minute delays
 * (::emberEventControlSetDelayQS and ::emberEventControlSetDelayMinutes) use
 * "binary" units. One quarter second is 256 ticks and one minute is 65536
 * ticks. Calling ::emberEventControlSetDelayMinutes(someEvent, 3) on the
 * EM357 SoC will schedule the event for 3 minutes * (65536 ticks / minute) *
 * (1000 milliseconds / 1024 ticks) = ~3.2 minutes. It is possible to avoid
 * these binary units by using ::emberEventControlSetDelayMS and the various
 * MILLISECOND_TICKS_PER_XXX multipliers. For example, calling
 * ::emberEventControlSetDelayMS(someEvent, 3 * MILLISECOND_TICKS_PER_MINUTE)
 * will delay for 3 minutes on any platform. Be aware of
 * ::EMBER_MAX_EVENT_CONTROL_DELAY_MS when using this approach.
 *
 * Following are some brief usage examples.
 * @code
 * EmberEventControl delayEvent;
 * EmberEventControl signalEvent;
 * EmberEventControl periodicEvent;
 *
 * void delayEventHandler(void)
 * {
 *   &frasl;&frasl; Disable this event until its next use.
 *   emberEventControlSetInactive(delayEvent);
 * }
 *
 * void signalEventHandler(void)
 * {
 *   &frasl;&frasl; Disable this event until its next use.
 *   emberEventControlSetInactive(signalEvent);
 *
 *   &frasl;&frasl; Sometimes we need to do something 100 ms later.
 *   if (somethingIsExpected)
 *     emberEventControlSetDelayMS(delayEvent, 100);
 * }
 *
 * void periodicEventHandler(void)
 * {
 *   emberEventControlSetDelayQS(periodicEvent, 4);
 * }
 *
 * void someIsr(void)
 * {
 *   &frasl;&frasl; Set the signal event to run at the first opportunity.
 *   emberEventControlSetActive(signalEvent);
 * }
 *
 * &frasl;&frasl; Put the controls and handlers in an array to run in
 * &frasl;&frasl; this order.
 * EmberEventData events[] =
 *  {
 *    { &delayEvent,    delayEventHandler },
 *    { &signalEvent,   signalEentHandler },
 *    { &periodicEvent, periodicEventHandler },
 *    { NULL, NULL }                            &frasl;&frasl; terminator
 *  };
 *
 * void main(void)
 * {
 *   &frasl;&frasl; Cause the periodic event to occur once a second.
 *   emberEventControlSetDelayQS(periodicEvent, 4);
