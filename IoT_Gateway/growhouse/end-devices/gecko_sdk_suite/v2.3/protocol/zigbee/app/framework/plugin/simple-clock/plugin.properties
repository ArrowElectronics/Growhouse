# Description of the plugin.
description=Ember implementation of a simple clock.  The plugin provides time keeping functionality to the framework and the application through implementations of both emberAfGetCurrentTimeCallback and emberAfSetTimeCallback.  When the application knows the current time (e.g., by reading the time attribute from a time server), it should call emberAfSetTime to keep the plugin synchronized.  The plugin is not a substitute for an accurate clock and is only intended for use during development.  Prior to production, this plugin should be replaced with code that provides more accurate time.
