/** @brief Timeout
 *
 * This function is called by the Trust Center Keepalive plugin when the Trust
 * Center fails to acknowledge enough keepalive messages. Upon timing out,
 * the Trust Center Keepalive plugin code will initiate a search for a new
 * Trust Center, which falls in line with the Trust Center Swapout feature.
 * Applications may consume this callback and have it return true in order to
 * prevent the Trust Center Keepalive plugin code from issuing a Trust Center
 * (insecure) rejoin. Doing so will also give the application a chance to
 * implement its own rejoin algorithm or logic. If this callback returns false,
 * the Trust Center Keepalive plugin code will proceed with issuing a Trust
 * Center rejoin.
