# Description of the plugin.
description=Ember implementation of the Zigbee Over-the-air Bootload Server Cluster (a multi-hop, application bootloader).  This implementation serves up file from an OTA storage device and sends the data to clients.  It also controls when they can upgrade to the downloaded file.

# List of .c files that need to be compiled and linked in.
sourceFiles=ota-server.c, ota-server-page-request.c, ota-server-cli.c, ota-server-dynamic-block-period.c

# List of callbacks implemented by this plugin
implementedCallbacks=emberAfOtaBootloadClusterServerInitCallback, emberAfOtaBootloadClusterServerTickCallback, emberAfOtaServerIncomingMessageRawCallback, emberAfOtaServerSendImageNotifyCallback

# Turn this on by default
includedByDefault=true

# Which clusters does it depend on
dependsOnClusterServer=over the air bootloading

  # The tick above in the implementedCallbacks line is tied to an endpoint; this
  # tick is endpointless

options=pageRequestSupport, minBlockRequestSupport, dynamicMinBlockPeriodSupport, maxNumDynamicOtaDownloads

pageRequestSupport.name=Page Request Support
pageRequestSupport.description=Whether the server supports clients making an OTA page request.
pageRequestSupport.type=BOOLEAN
pageRequestSupport.default=false

minBlockRequestSupport.name=Minimum Block Request Support
minBlockRequestSupport.description=Whether the server supports the Minimum Block Period support field in the Image Block Request/Response messages. This is used to rate limit clients.
minBlockRequestSupport.type=BOOLEAN
minBlockRequestSupport.default=FALSE

dynamicMinBlockPeriodSupport.name=Dynamic Block Request Support
dynamicMinBlockPeriodSupport.description=If the Minimum Block Request Support is enabled, this additional support provides dynamically treating the Minimum Block Period field as milliseconds or seconds, depending on the OTA client's support. When a client starts an OTA transfer, it will be probed to determine whether it treats the Minimum Block Period as seconds or milliseconds, and the determination will be used throughout the OTA transfer.
dynamicMinBlockPeriodSupport.type=BOOLEAN
dynamicMinBlockPeriodSupport.default=FALSE
dynamicMinBlockPeriodSupport.dependsOn=minBlockRequestSupport

maxNumDynamicOtaDownloads.name=Number of Simultaneous Dynamic Block Period Downloads
maxNumDynamicOtaDownloads.description=If the Dynamic Minimum Block Request Support is enabled, this option's value dictates how many simultaneous OTA client transfers are supported at one time. When at full capacity, Query Next Image Requests will be responded to, but Image Block Requests and Page Requests will be told to delay until a free connection opens up, which will occur when a device concludes the OTA process. A device will be aged out as an active connection if it does not query a piece of the OTA file at least once every 60 seconds.
maxNumDynamicOtaDownloads.type=NUMBER:1,50
maxNumDynamicOtaDownloads.default=5
maxNumDynamicOtaDownloads.dependsOn=dynamicMinBlockPeriodSupport
