                    from every node in the network back to this node.
                    This function should be called by an application
                    that wishes to communicate with many nodes, for
                    example, a gateway, central monitor, or controller.
                    A device using this function was referred to as an
                    'aggregator' in EmberZNet 2.x and earlier, and is
                    referred to as a 'concentrator' in the ZigBee
                    specification and EmberZNet 3. <p> This function
                    enables large scale networks, because the other
                    devices do not have to individually perform
                    bandwidth-intensive route discoveries. Instead, when a
                    remote node sends an APS unicast to a concentrator,
                    its network layer automatically delivers a special
                    route record packet first, which lists the network
                    ids of all the intermediate relays. The concentrator
                    can then use source routing to send outbound APS
                    unicasts. (A source routed message is one in which
                    the entire route is listed in the network layer
                    header.) This allows the concentrator to communicate
                    with thousands of devices without requiring large
                    route tables on neighboring nodes. <p> This function
                    is only available in ZigBee Pro (stack profile 2),
                    and cannot be called on end devices. Any router
                    can be a concentrator (not just the coordinator),
                    and there can be multiple concentrators on a
                    network. <p> Note that a concentrator does not
                    automatically obtain routes to all network nodes
                    after calling this function. Remote applications must
                    first initiate an inbound APS unicast. <p>
                    Many-to-one routes are not repaired automatically.
                    Instead, the concentrator application must call this
                    function to rediscover the routes as necessary, for
                    example, upon failure of a retried APS message. The
                    reason for this is that there is no scalable
                    one-size-fits-all route repair strategy. A common and
                    recommended strategy is for the concentrator
                    application to refresh the routes by calling this
                    function periodically.",

    {
      value: "0xA6",

      description: "LEGACY FUNCTION: This functionality has been
                    replaced by a single bit in the EmberApsFrame,
                    EMBER_APS_OPTION_DSA_SIGN. Devices wishing to send
                    signed messages should use that as it requires
                    fewer function calls and message buffering. The
                    dsaSignHandler response is still called when
                    EMBER_APS_OPTION_DSA_SIGN is used. However, this
                    function is still supported. This function begins
                    the process of signing the passed message contained
                    within the messageContents array. If no other ECC
                    operation is going on, it will immediately return
                    with EMBER_OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS to indicate the start
                    of ECC operation. It will delay a period of time
                    to let APS retries take place, but then it will
                    shut down the radio and consume the CPU processing
                    until the signing is complete. This may take up to
                    1 second. The signed message will be returned in
                    the dsaSignHandler response. Note that the last byte
                    of the messageContents passed to this function has
                    special significance. As the typical use case for
                    DSA signing is to sign the ZCL payload of a DRLC
                    Report Event Status message in SE 1.0, there is
                    often both a signed portion (ZCL payload) and an
                    unsigned portion (ZCL header). The last byte in the
                    content of messageToSign is therefore used as a
                    special indicator to signify how many bytes of
                    leading data in the array should be excluded from
                    consideration during the signing process. If the
                    signature needs to cover the entire array (all
                    bytes except last one), the caller should ensure
                    that the last byte of messageContents is 0x00. When
                    the signature operation is complete, this final byte
                    will be replaced by the signature type indicator
                    (0x01 for ECDSA signatures), and the actual
                    signature will be appended to the original contents
                    after this byte.",
