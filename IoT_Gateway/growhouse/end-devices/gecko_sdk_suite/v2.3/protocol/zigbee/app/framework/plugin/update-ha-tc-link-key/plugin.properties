name=HA Device Trust Center Link Key Update
description=This plugin contributes non-compliant behavior to update the trust center link key of legacy HA devices. This plugin makes use of the Device Database plugin to be notified of when a device joins the network of a trust center. When a node joins, this plugin will check the stack revision of the node. If the node's stack revision is not R21 or greater, the plugin will forcefully update the joining device's trust center link key via a Transport Key APS command. Note that this plugin is meant to be using on a trust center only (i.e., not on a joining device).
