description=This code is for a Trust Center, and will handle the process of updating the Network Key by UNICASTING that key to each device encrypted with their link key.  It is intended for use in Smart Energy networks.  It will traverse the Trust Center's local key table and send the new NWK key to each non-sleepy device with an authorized link key (a device that has successfully performed key establishment).  The new network key will be randomly generated.  Once all the messages have been sent, it will broadcast a key switch message.
