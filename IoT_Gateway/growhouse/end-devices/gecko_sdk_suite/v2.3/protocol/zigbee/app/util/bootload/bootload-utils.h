/**

 * All functions and variables defined here can be used by applications.
 * See bootload-utils.h for source code.
 *
 * Applications can use this stand-alone bootload library to:
 * -# Load a new (application) image on itself via serial bootload through
 *    uart port 1 using the xmodem protocol.
 * -# Load a new image on a remote node over-the-air (OTA) from a host (PC),
 *    also known as a passthru bootload.
 * -# Recover a node that failed during the bootloading process,
 *    also known as a recovery bootload.
 *
 * Note from the diagrams below that with over-the-air bootloading the source node
 * (node transmitting bootload packets) and the target node (node being loaded
 * with a new image) need to be one hop away because bootload packets are
 * IEEE 802.15.4 packets.
 *
 * In case of recovery, the source (recovery) node does not need
 * to be part of the network since all recovery packets are 802.15.4 packets.
 *
