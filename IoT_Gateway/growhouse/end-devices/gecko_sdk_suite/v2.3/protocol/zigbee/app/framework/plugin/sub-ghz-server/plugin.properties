description=The Smart Energy Sub-GHz server monitors its duty cycle and that of all the clients. Once a Limited threshold is reached, the Sub-GHz server instructs the offending client to suspend sending any more ZCL messages for a certain period. On reaching the Critical threshold, the suspend ZCL messages command is broadcast to all clients.
