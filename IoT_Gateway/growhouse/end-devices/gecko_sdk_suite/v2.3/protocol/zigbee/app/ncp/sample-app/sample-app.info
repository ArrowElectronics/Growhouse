ncp-spi {
  name=NCP SPI
  dir=ncp-spi
  isc=ncp-spi/ncp-spi.isc
  include=.internal_hwconfig
  This network coprocessor (NCP) application supports communication with a host
  application over a SPI interface.  This NCP application can be built as
  configured, or optionally can be augmented with customized extensions for
  initialization, main loop processing, event definition/handling, and
  messaging with the host.
