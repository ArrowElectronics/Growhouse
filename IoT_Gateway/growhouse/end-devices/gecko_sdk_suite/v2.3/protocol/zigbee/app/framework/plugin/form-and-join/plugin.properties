name=Form and Join Library

description=This is the original Form and Join library (given as source code) that provides a simple approach to form on an unused pan ID, or find any open network that can be joined to.  This functionality can be paired with the network-find plugin.  However both are superceded by the Network Steering plugin that provides a more robust and complete solution.
