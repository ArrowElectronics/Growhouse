/**
 * @file: counters-ota.h
 *
 * Description: A library for retrieving Ember stack counters over the air.
 *
 * The library allows the application to request counters from a remote
 * node.  The request specifies whether the remote node should clear
 * its counters after sending back the response.
 * The library also handles and responds to incoming counter requests apropriately.
 * A convenience method recognizes incoming responses.
 *
 * Summary of requirements:
 * - Include counters.c and counters-ota.c in the build on an EmberZNet processor.
 *   Include only counters-ota-host.c in the build on an EZSP host processor.
 * - Call ::emberIsIncomingCountersRequest() in the incoming message handler.
 * - Call ::emberIsIncomingCountersResponse() in the incoming message handler.
 * - Call ::emberIsOutgoingCountersResponse() in the message sent handler.
 *
 * The request and response messages use profile id EMBER_PRIVATE_PROFILE_ID,
 * and the following cluster ids:
 *
 * - EMBER_REPORT_COUNTERS_REQUEST
 * - EMBER_REPORT_AND_CLEAR_COUNTERS_REQUEST
 * - EMBER_REPORT_COUNTERS_RESPONSE
 * - EMBER_REPORT_AND_CLEAR_COUNTERS_RESPONSE
 *
 * The request has no payload.  The payload of the response is a list of the
 * non-zero counters.  Each entry in the list consists of the one-byte counter
 * id followed by a two-byte counter, low byte first.  If all entries do not
 * fit into a single payload, multiple response messages are sent.
