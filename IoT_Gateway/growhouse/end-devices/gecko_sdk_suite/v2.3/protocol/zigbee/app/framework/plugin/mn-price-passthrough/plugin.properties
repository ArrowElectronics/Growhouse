# Description of the plugin.
description=Plugin to demonstrate the capabilities of multi-network support.  The plugin will act as a Price cluster client on one network and a Price cluster server on another network.  As a client, it will periodically poll a remote server for pricing information and then store the data locally.  As a server, it makes that pricing information available to clients, thereby proxying the data between networks.
