# Change Log

All notable changes to the bootloader will be documented in this file. The
version number given in the Change Log is on the format `major`.`minor`.`patch`.

## 1.6.0 - 2018-05-23

### Added
 - The GBL parser now support LZMA compressed programming tags. Decompression
   is only supported when running in the context of the bootloader, not using
   the application interface. Verification of a GBL file containing compressed
   tags is supported in both modes of operation.
 - A version of the GBL parser without support for AES encrypted files has been
   added. This version of the parser can be used to save flash space if
   upgrade image encryption is not required.
 - A version of the storage library without support for multiple storage slots
   has been added. This version of the storage library can be used to save flash
   space if only a single storage slot is used.

### Changed
 - CRC32 is now performed using the GPCRC peripheral rather than a software
   implementation. This should increase performance.

## Fixed
 - When using HFXO as the clock source for HFPERCLK, the SPI driver did not
   calculate the correct clock divider, causing an incorrect baud rate.
 - Data in GBL Metadata tags was not correctly returned in the metadata
   callback.
 - The first stage bootloader could fail to apply a bootloader upgrade if
   power was lost during the upgrade. The window for failure opened when the
   first page of the main bootloader was erased, and closed when the new main
   bootloader was completely written. The first stage bootloader is now more
   resilient to power loss.

## 1.5.0 - 2018-02-23

### Added
 - Initial support for EFM32TG11 has been added in this release.

### Changed
 - All memory accesses in the Gecko bootloader are now aligned.

## 1.4.1 - 2017-12-21

### Added

 - Added more prebuilt bootloader binaries for EFR32 in default configuration.

## 1.4.0 - 2017-09-30

### Added
 - Support for EFR32xG14, EFM32PG1, EFM32PG12, EFM32JG1, EFM32JG12 and
   EFM32GG11 has been added in this release.

### Changed
 - The Gecko bootloader now uses HAL Configuration headers for peripheral
   configuration, rather than its own set of #defines. Support for the
   Hardware Configurator has also been integrated into the Application Builder
   for the Gecko bootloader. This allows for graphical configuration.
 - All cryptographic operations using the CRYPTO hardware accelerator protect
   critical operations using critical sections, allowing preemption of CRYPTO
   operations when using the application interface.
 - The `bootloader_getImageInfo` function now returns an error code if the
   storage slot is invalid or empty.

### Fixed
 - When verifying an LZ4 compressed image in storage using the application
   interface, the bootloader could erroneously touch application RAM outside
   the allocated context.
 - An issue preventing bootloader upgrades from working when applied in a GBL
   file together with a compressed application image has been resolved.

## 1.3.0 - 2017-07-28

### Changed
 - The GBL and EBL upgrade image parsing support has been split out from the
   core bootloader library `libbootloader` into two libraries `libparser` and
   `libparser-eblv2`. The former supports GBL only, the latter supports both
   GBL and the legacy EBL format. Selection of which library to use is done
   by selecting the "Image Parser" or "Image Parser with legacy EBL support"
   plugin in AppBuilder. Users who previously enabled EBL support by checking
   "Allow legacy format" in the Image Parser plugin, should use the new
   "Image Parser with legacy EBL support" plugin instead.

### Fixed
 - The image parser for GBL files could fail to write data to address 0x8004
   if the word at that address started with 0xFF.
 - The LZ4 decompressor for compressed GBL files could in rare cases repeat
   the wrong byte when decompressing certain repeated patterns.

## 1.2.0 - 2017-06-16

### Added
 - The GBL parser now supports LZ4 compressed programming tags. Decompression
   is only supported when running in the context of the bootloader, not using
   the application interface. Verification of a GBL file containing compressed
   tags is supported in both modes of operation.

### Changed
 - The `parser_parse` function takes a flags argument, which is used to signal
   whether tags such as the LZ4 compressed tag should be parsed (decompressed)
   or skipped over. If `flags = PARSER_FLAG_PARSE_CUSTOM_TAGS`, custom tags will
   be fully parsed. If `flags = 0`, custom tags will be treated as binary blobs
   that are passed over.
 - Enumeration values with too generic names have been renamed to prevent naming
   collisions with other software components. In `BootloaderType_t`, `NONE` has
   been renamed `NO_BOOTLOADER`. In `BootloaderStorageType_t`, `CUSTOM` has been
   renamed `CUSTOM_STORAGE`.
 - Main bootloader main function has been refactored to allow running a
   bootloader that supports both storage and communication. When both a storage
   and a communication plugin is enabled, the storage plugin will run first. If
   it reports anything other than a firmware upgrade success, the communication
   plugin will run.

### Fixed
 - A false verification failure using the `bootloader_verifyApplication`
   function for CRC-checksummed application images that did not start at the
   beginning of the application area in main flash has been fixed.
 - Prebuilt sample bootloader binaries were previously added to all
   bootloader projects in Simplicity Studio. These have now been moved to a
   different location to avoid cluttering up the projects.
 - Default enable pin for UART on BRD4165B changed from PA5 to PA4 to reflect
   actual board configuration.

## 1.1.0 - 2017-06-09

### Added
 - The `bootloader_verifyApplication` function now supports verifying all
   applications. If secure boot is enforced, the function will only return
   `true` if the cryptographic signature of the application is valid. Else, the
   application is verified according to the signature type present in the
   application ApplicationProperties_t structure.
 - The SPI flash storage plugin now supports graphical configuration of SPI
   flash write protect and hold pins. Configuring these pins is required for the
   bootloader to successfully communicate with the stacked flash in the
   EFR32MG1[BP][67]32 SiPs.

### Changed
 - The internal flash write routine `flash_writeBuffer` now returns `true`
   if given a zero-length buffer to write. This improves the backwards
   compatibility of the behavior of the bootloader interface for internal
   storage bootloaders.
 - The added capability of `bootloader_verifyApplication` means that it will now
   return `true` instead of `false` when verifying an unsigned application when
   secure boot is _not_ enabled.

### Fixed
 - The Bluetooth in-place OTA bootloader sample configuration was erroneously
   not visible for EFR32MG1 in Simplicity Studio
 - The image parser for legacy EBL files would silently fail to completely apply
   upgrade images containing zero-length ERASEPROG tags, which Simplicity
   Commander sometimes could output (sequences of "FD03000400000000" near the end of
   the EBL file). If zero-length ERASEPROG tags were present, data would not be
   flashed to the word starting at address 0x8004.
 - The image parser for legacy EBL files would fail to indicate that the image
   contained an application upgrade, causing the storage plugin to abort
   the upgrade process, even though the image was valid.

## 1.0.0 - 2017-03-10
### Added
 - Initial release of Gecko Bootloader
