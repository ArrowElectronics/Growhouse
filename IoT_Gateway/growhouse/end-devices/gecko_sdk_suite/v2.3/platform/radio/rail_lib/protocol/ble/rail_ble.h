///
/// The APIs in this module configure the radio for BLE
/// operation and provide additional helper routines necessary for
/// normal BLE send/receive that aren't available directly in RAIL.
/// RAIL APIs should be used to set up the application. However,
/// RAIL_ConfigChannels() and RAIL_ConfigRadio() should not be called to set up
/// the PHY. Instead, RAIL_BLE_Config* APIs should be used to set up the
/// 1 Mbps, 2 Mbps, or Coded PHY configurations needed by the application. These
/// APIs will configure the hardware and also configure the set of valid BLE
/// channels.
///
/// To implement a standard BLE link layer, you will also need to handle tight
/// turnaround times and send packets at specific instants. This can all be
/// managed through general RAIL functions, such as RAIL_ScheduleTx(),
/// RAIL_ScheduleRx(), and RAIL_SetStateTiming(). See RAIL APIs for more
/// useful functions.
///
/// A simple example to set up the application to be in BLE mode is shown
/// below. Note that this will put the radio on the first advertising channel
/// with the advertising Access Address. In any full-featured BLE application you
/// will need to use the RAIL_BLE_ConfigChannelRadioParams() function to change
/// the sync word and other parameters as needed based on your connection.
