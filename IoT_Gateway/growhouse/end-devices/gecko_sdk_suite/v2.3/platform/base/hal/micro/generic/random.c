 *    the stdlib rand() takes about 2.25ms @3.68MHz on the AVR
 *    hell- you can run an software implimentation AES cipher block in 1.5ms!
 *    obviously an LFSR method is much faster (12us on a 4MHz 128AVR actually).
 *    in the FPGA we did the first poly you see here but on a 32bit seed,
 *    taking only the msb word, but we quickly noticed a sequential nature
 *    in the output. so at each random number generation we actually ran the
 *    LFSR 16 times. we can avoid that but still remove the sequential nature
 *    and get a good looking spread by running two LFSRs and XORing them.
