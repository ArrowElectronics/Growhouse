name=Simulated EEPROM version 2 Library
description=This library simulates an EEPROM within the internal flash of the chip to maximize the lifetime of flash pages and reduce write cycles.  The simulated EEPROM extends the lifetime of flash by wear leveling writes across the flash.  It is used for persistent storage of tokens for the network and application layers.  The network tokens are automatically managed by the network stack.  The application may add its own tokens.  SimEE1 and SimEE2 share the same fundamental limits on maximum number of tokens, maximum token or element size, and maximum number of elements in an indexed token. Maximum sum total of all token sizes is 2 kB in version 1 and 8 kB in version 2.  Version 2 is designed to reduce the time needed when an application writes a token, at the expense of consuming more flash.  Therefore SimEE2 is more appropriate when writing an element within a large set of tokens during time critical operations.  For example setting a binding within a 100 entry binding table.  Page erasure is under application control, via a callback, due to requiring the chip to disable interrupts during the erasure.  See Application note AN703 for more information.  This library requires the Simulated EEPROM version 1 to version 2 upgrade library or stub upgrade library.
