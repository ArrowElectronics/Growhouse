# This is an example yaml file.
# Basically you have to create a map of questions.
# Then each question has a things inside, most importantly the answers.
#
# Each answer should have a "description" scalar map, and a
# "macros" and "files" map to a list of macros and files to add to the
# project.
# "default: true" should be put if this is a default answer. If you don't have
# a default answer, then nothing happens unless user sets an answer.
#
# See example below, ask questions if confused.
