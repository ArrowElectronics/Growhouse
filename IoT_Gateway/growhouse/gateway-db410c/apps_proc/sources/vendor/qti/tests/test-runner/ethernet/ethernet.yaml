    description: "Checking Ethernet speed by sending ping to router and checking results.
                  Prerequisites:
                    1. Router working and connected to DUT with LAN
                    2. No other Ethernet connection for DUT
                  Test process:
                    1. Get router IP
                    2. Disable other connections
                    3. Ping router
                    4. Enable other connections
                    5. Check response speed"

    #                             if ping response time will be bigger than the given value, the test will fail 
    # ping_timeout_s            : time the ping should last
