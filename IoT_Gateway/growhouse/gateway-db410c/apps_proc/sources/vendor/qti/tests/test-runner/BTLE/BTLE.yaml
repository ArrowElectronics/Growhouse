    description: "testing bluetooth by scanning for BTLE devices and, if BTLE MAC address is defined,
                  checking if expected BTLE is found fast enough"

    devices:
        - apq8096-sbc

params:
    # scan_seconds:           time the scan will last if no error will be received
    # BTLE_MAC:               MAC address on BTLE device that is expected to be found by scan operation on DUT
    
    # scan_seconds default value is 7 seconds
    # scan_seconds minimum value is 2 seconds (if less time is given, the scan_seconds minimum value will be used)
    
    # BTLE_MAC is an optional argument. If it is not given, the test will return "pass" in case
    # any bluetooth device was found. If BTLE_MAC is given, the test will return "pass" only if the given BTLE_MAC
    # was found.
