#this file is meant to serve the user to manage environment variables to suit the application to his/her working environment


#IMPORTANT!  if you change this file name you also have to change it in "get-env-var-val-target.sh" utility 
#it's the only place this file name is hard codded

#======> mandatory variables for user <=============

#please specify target-device IP
#this IP belongs to the board connected to the working station that the test-scripts will be run on
TARGET_DEVICE_IP=<IP of DUT>

#user name with user privileges - for commands that must be executed as user and not root
TARGET_DEVICE_USER=<DUT user name. e.g linaro>

#this IP belongs to the second board connected to the working station that the TARGET_DEVICE board will use to run special test-scripts.
#test-scripts like "wifi-soft-ap-connect.sh" that uses the HELPER_DEVICE to connect to the AP created by the TARGET_DEVICE
HELPER_DEVICE_IP=<IP of helper board>

#========> content files for testing <======================
#path to directory containing content files needed for testing, e.g.: sound files for audio tests, video file Etc
CONTENT_FILE_PATH=<full path to my content files/<content dir name>>

#name of dir containing content files for testing in DUT
#must be the same name as dir name of CONTENT_FILE_PATH
CLIENT_CONTENT_DIR=<content dir name>


#populate the directory with files with these specific names:
SOUND_FILE_WAV=<fileName.wav>

#=====> make sure the MP3 file Sampling rate is 44.1 KHz!
SOUND_FILE_MP3=<fileName.mp3>

SOUND_FILE_OGG=ACDC_-_<fileName.ogg>

# Video files needs to be at least 9 MIN long for video stability test to succeed
VIDEO_FILE_1080P_24FPS_MOV=<1080p 24FPS mov file e.g big_buck_bunny_1080p_h264.mov>
VIDEO_FILE_1080P_30FPS_MOV=<1080p 30FPS mov file e.g big_buck_bunny_1080p_30fps.MOV>
VIDEO_FILE_1080P_60FPS_MP4=<1080p 60FPS mp4 file e.g bbb_sunflower_1080p_60fps_normal.mp4>
VIDEO_FILE_720P_24FPS_MOV=<720p 24FPS mov file e.g big_buck_bunny_720p_h264.mov>


# ========> optional variables for user <================
SOUND_FILE_MSG_TO_USER=msg_to_user
LED_TEST_MSG_TO_USER=MSG_TO_USER_LED_TEST

###### with these variables the developer builds paths to run test/utility scripts on DUT ######
###  mostly used in generally-used-variables.txt  ###

#name of directory created in the targed device
TARGET_BASE_PATH=/home/root/tiny-apts

#name of directory containing test scripts on target devices and on work-station
TEST_SCRIPT_DIR=test-scripts

#wifi test-scripts dir name
WIFI_TESTS_DIR=wifi

#name of directory containing utilities used by test scripts and by tiny-apts scripts on target devices and on work-station
UTIL_DIR=util

#name of directory containing tests to be run from the working station
STATION_TEST_DIR=station-test-scripts
