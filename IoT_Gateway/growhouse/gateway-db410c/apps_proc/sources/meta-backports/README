Meta-backports
================================

Introduction
-------------------------

This layer is a place for backports against stable OpenEmbedded releases. For
stable OpenEmbedded releases, only bug fixes are merged by the OE developers,
and sometimes it might be useful to have newer versions of some components. This
layer will provide such facility.

We will accept backports from OE-core and meta-oe only, at least to start with.

The meta-backports layer depends on:

	URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
	layers: meta
	branch: rocko

	URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
	layers: meta-oe
	branch: rocko

Please follow the recommended setup procedures of your OE distribution. For
Angstrom that is http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/building-angstrom, other
distros should have similar online resources.

Notes
-------------------------

The recipes are organized by 'layer name' in the top level folder, such that
recipes are parsed (and used) only if the corresponding layer is enabled in your
current configuration. This is to avoid bringing un-needed (or even unexpected)
dependencies into your build environment.

Contributing
-------------------------

If you want to contribute changes, you can send Gerrit merge requests at
https://review.linaro.org/#/q/project:openembedded/meta-backports, against the
rocko branch.

Alternatively you can send patches to openembedded@lists.linaro.org, in which
case, please:

* When creating patches, please use something like:

`git format-patch -s --subject-prefix='meta-backports][PATCH][rocko' origin`

* When sending patches, please use something like:

`git send-email --to openembedded@lists.linaro.org <generated patch>`

You can discuss about this layer, on `#linaro` on FreeNode IRC network.
