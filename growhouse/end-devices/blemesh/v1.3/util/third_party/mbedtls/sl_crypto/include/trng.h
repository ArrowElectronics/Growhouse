 * \brief True Random Number Generator (TRNG) driver for Silicon Labs devices.
 *
 * \details The EFR32xG12 and EFM32xG12 and newer Silicon Labs devices contains
 * a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) peripheral. The TRNG is a
 * non-deterministic random number generator based on a full hardware solution.
 * The TRNG contains a 64 x 32-bit FIFO for reading out random numbers.
 *
 * The samples from entropy source within the TRNG are monitored permanently by
 * 4 built in tests that detect issues with the noise source. The tests are
 * specified in NIST-800-90B and AIS31. The tests that are always checking the
 * entropy source are "Repetition Count Test", "Adaptive Proportion Test
 * (64-sample window)", "Adaptive Proportion Test (4096-sample window)" and
 * the "AIS31 Online Test".
 *
 * In addition the TRNG has options for running startup tests. When these tests
 * are enabled the TRNG FIFO will not contains any data before all the startup
 * tests have passed. There are 4 TRNG startup tests, 3 of the tests are
 * specified in NIST-800-90B. These are the "Repetition Count Test", "Adaptive
 * Proportion Test (64-sample window)" and "Adaptive Proportion Test
 * (4096-sample window)". The last startup test is the AIS31 startup test. By
 * default when using this driver all the startup tests are enabled.

 * The TRNG module implements an entropy source plugin module for mbed TLS that can
 * be used in applications needing random numbers or indirectly using mbed TLS
 * modules that depend on the random number generation interfaces of mbed TLS.
 * The define @ref MBEDTLS_TRNG_C will compile the TRNG module. The TRNG is enbabled as
 * an mbed TLS entropy source by defining @ref MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_ALT,
 * @ref MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_INIT_ALT and @ref MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_FREE_ALT.
 * The TRNG functions are declared in the 'mbedtls/sl_crypto/include/trng.h' file.
