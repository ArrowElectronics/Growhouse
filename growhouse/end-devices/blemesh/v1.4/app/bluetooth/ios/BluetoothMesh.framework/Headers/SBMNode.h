/**
 A SBMNode is the object that contains all the information about a Bluetooth Mesh device in a Network. It is created right after provision a device. After add node to group (Configure available models from DCD), it will be possible to get all configured Elements and Models from the configuration object. DCD can be also downloaded manually without adding to the specific group.
