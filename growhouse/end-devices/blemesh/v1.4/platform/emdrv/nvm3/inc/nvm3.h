   @n @section nvm3_intro Introduction
   The NVM3 driver provides a way for an application to safely store and
   retrieve variable size objects in a page based non-volatile memory.
   Objects are identified with 20-bit object identifiers denoted as keys.

   The driver is designed to use pages in a sequential order to provide equal
   usage and wear. The driver is resilient to power loss or reset events,
   ensuring that objects retrieved from the driver are in a valid state. A
   valid object will always be the last successfully stored object. NVM3 can
   detect NVM defects and mark pages as unusable. NVM3 will continue to operate
   on good pages after defect pages are detected.

   @n @section nvm3_objects Objects
   A NVM3 object is a piece of data that can be stored in NVM. The object
   is handled as an array of bytes up to @ref NVM3_MAX_OBJECT_SIZE in size.
   NVM3 can handle two types of objects.
   -# Regular data objects. Data objects can store information of
   any size up to maximum @ref NVM3_MAX_OBJECT_SIZE bytes.
   -# 32-bit counter objects. Counter objects can store 32-bit counters that are
   accessed with a separate set of API functions. The counter object is designed
   to be compact while minimizing memory wear in applications that require
   frequent persistent counter increments.

   See @ref nvm3_api for more details on the API.

   @n @section nvm3_repack Repacking
   As the NVM fills up, there will be a point where it can no longer store
   additional objects, and a repacking operation is required to release
   out-of-date objects to free up NVM. Because erasing pages takes a long time,
   the NVM3 driver does not trigger the process by itself unless free memory
   reaches a critical low level. As an alternative, the application can trigger
   the repacking process by calling the @ref nvm3_repack() function.
   During the call, NVM3 will either move data to a new page or erase pages
   that can be reused. At most, the call will block for a period equal to a page
   erasure time plus a small execution overhead. Page erasure time for the
   EFM32 or EFR32 parts can be found in the data sheet.

   The application can use @ref nvm3_repackNeeded() to determine if repacking
   is needed. The @ref nvm3_repack() is used to do the actual repacks, and it
   will perform repacks only if the operation is needed.

   NVM3 uses two thresholds for repacking:
   -# Forced threshold. This is the threshold used to force automatic repacking
      when free memory reaches a critical low level.
   -# User threshold. This is the threshold used by @ref nvm3_repackNeeded().
      @ref nvm3_repack() will not perform repacking unless free memory is below
      this threshold.

   A NVM3 function that deletes or modifies a data or counter object will trigger
   an automatic repack operation when free memory is below the forced threshold.
   The check is done before the object is modified, not after.

   The user can define the user threshold by entering a value in the repackHeadroom
   member of the @ref nvm3_Init_t struct used by the @ref nvm3_open() function.
   The repackHeadroom value defines the difference between the user and forced
   threshold. The forced threshold is the minimum low memory threshold defined
   by the page size and maximum object size and cannot be changed by the user.
   The default value for the repack headroom is 0, meaning that the forced and
   user thresholds are equal.

   @note The repack threshold can be changed to avoid that multiple modifications
   of objects between user called repacks are causing automatic repacks. Care
   should be taken because "high" values of the repack headroom may cause
   increased NVM wear from increased number of repacks.

   @n @section nvm3_cache Caching
   Caching is an optional feature. The NVM3 cache is an object location lookup
   cache, data is not stored in the cache. Using the cache will speed up accesses
   to the objects, and the performance will very much depend on objects beeing
   available in the cache. To ensure that the cache can hold all neccesary
   information, it must be configured to a size equivalent or larger than the
   number of objects stored in NVM including those deleted as long as they are
   not discarded by the repack function. If the cache is available,
   the driver will first look in the cache to find the position of the object in NVM.
   If the object position is not found in the cache, the object position will be
   found by searching the NVM. The search will start at the last stored object
   and search all the way to the oldest object. If the object is found, the cache
   is updated accordingly.

   It is the application that must allocate and support the data for the cache,
   see the @ref nvm3_open function for more details. The size of each cache
   element is one uint32_t and one pointer giving a total of 8 bytes (2 words)
   pr. entry for EFM32 and EFR32 devices.

   @note The cache is fully initialized by @ref nvm3_open() and automatically
   updated by any subsequent write, read, or delete function call.

   @n @section nvm3_data Global Data (variables)
   The NVM3 library is using some global variables to store intermediate data
   during open, read, write, increment and delete calls. Because the actual
   memory configuration is not defined at the time the NVM3 library is built,
   but rather at the time the user application is built, the size of the data
   structures must be determined by the application configuration.
   Also the value of the @ref nvm3MaxFragmentCount must be set by the
   application at run-time before any nvm3 funcntions are called.

   The nvm3 does not support overlapped calls. If there is any chance that the
   application can issue overlapped calls, the nvm3 locking mechanism must be
   present and protect from that.

   @note If the application is using more than one nvm3 instance, the variables
   will be shared between the instances. Be sure to allocate data that have a
   size that is large enough for the largest usage.

   @n @section nvm3_stack Stack Data
   The nvm3 library function calls are nested several levels deep. The stack
   usage has been measured on some EFR32 targets with library builds for IAR
   and armgcc, and the maximum stack usage measured was 388 bytes.

   @n @section nvm3_api The API
   The nvm3 API is defined in the @ref nvm3.h file, and the application code
   must include the @ref nvm3.h header file to get access to all definitions,
   datatypes and function prototypes defined by nvm3.

   This section contains brief descriptions of the nvm3 functions. For
   more information about parameters and return values see the Function
   Documentation section. Most functions return an @ref Ecode_t that has the
   value @ref ECODE_NVM3_OK on success or see @ref nvm3.h for other values.

   @ref nvm3_open() and @ref nvm3_close().
   @n Functions to open and close an NVM3 instance. @ref nvm3_open() takes a handle
   of type nvm3_Handle_t and initialization data of type @ref nvm3_Init_t.
   The helper macro pair @ref NVM3_DEFINE_SECTION_STATIC_DATA() and
   @ref NVM3_DEFINE_SECTION_INIT_DATA() are provided to simplify initialization
   data definition. For usage examples, see the @ref nvm3_example section.

   @ref nvm3_getObjectInfo(), @ref nvm3_enumObjects(), @ref nvm3_deleteObject()
   and nvm3_countObjects()
   @n These functions work on all objects. @ref nvm3_enumObjects() provides a
   way to get a list of keys to valid objects in the NVM. The search can also
   be constrained by the function parameters.
   @ref nvm3_countObjects() can be useful at startup to distinguish between a
   first startup without any valid objects present and later reboots with valid
   objects persistently stored in NVM.

   @ref nvm3_writeData() and @ref nvm3_readData()
   @n Functions to write and read data objects.

   @ref nvm3_writeCounter(), @ref nvm3_readCounter() and @ref nvm3_incrementCounter()
   @n Functions to write, read and increment 32-bit counter objects.

   @ref nvm3_eraseAll()
   @n Erase all objects in NVM.

   @ref nvm3_getEraseCount()
   @n Return the erasure count for the most erased page in NVM.

   @ref nvm3_repack() and @ref nvm3_repackNeeded()
   @n Manage NVM3 repacking operations.

   @ref nvm3_resize()
   @n Resize the NVM area used by an open NVM3 instance.

   @n @section nvm3_memory_placement Memory Placement
   The application is responsible for placing the NVM area correctly. Minimum
   requirements for memory placement are:
   -# NVM area start address must be aligned with a page of the underlying
    memory system.
   -# NVM area size must be a multiple of the page size.

   The minimim required NVM size is dependent on both the NVM page size and the
   NVM3_MAX_OBJECT_SIZE value. For a device with 2 kB page size and some typical
   values for NVM3_MAX_OBJECT_SIZE will give the following minimum required
   number of pages:
     - For NVM3_MAX_OBJECT_SIZE=208:  3 pages
     - For NVM3_MAX_OBJECT_SIZE=1900: 4 pages
     - For NVM3_MAX_OBJECT_SIZE=4096: 5 pages

   Two macros are provided to support the creation of the NVM area and initialization
   data; @ref NVM3_DEFINE_SECTION_STATIC_DATA() and @ref NVM3_DEFINE_SECTION_INIT_DATA().
   A linker section called 'name'_section is defined by @ref NVM3_DEFINE_SECTION_STATIC_DATA().
   The NVM area is placed within the linker section. The application linker script
   must place the section according to the requirements above. An error is returned
   by @ref nvm3_open() on alignment or size violation.

   @n @section nvm3_configuration Configuration Options
   There are no compile-time configuration options for NVM3. All configuration
   parameters are contained in @ref nvm3_Init_t.

   @note The @ref nvm3_data variables must however be configured for correct
   size and have correct values for the nvm3 to behave correctly.

   @n @section nvm3_bad_page_handling Bad NVM Page Handling
   The NVM3 has been designed to detect page erase and write errors during
   normal operation and mark failing pages as BAD. If a write operation
   fails, all objects that have been written to the page prior to the write
   error is copied to the next free page before the page is marked as BAD and
   the write operation resumes. If the recover operation is successful, the
   operation is regarded as complete and the function will return @ref
   ECODE_NVM3_OK status.

   @note Erase and write errors may not be detected by NVM3 if the device is
   used until end of life where the failure mode can be that the NVM content is
   changing during a power cycle.

   @n @section nvm3_error_handling Error Handling
   The NVM3 error handling is classic in the way that most of the functions
   returns an error code. The @ref nvm3_countObjects is the only function that
   differs from this sceme because it returns the actual number of objects
   found.

   The behaviour and return values from most of the functions like @ref
   nvm3_readData, @ref nvm3_writeData etc. should be pretty self explanatory,
   while the @ref nvm3_open is a bit different. @ref nvm3_open will always try
   to recover from the previous state and continue without any error if possible.
   The rationale behind this is that if a valid NVM3 instance has been
   established, @ref nvm3_open will recover from brown outs and power cycles at
   any time in any operation and bring the system to a valid state where all
   pages and objects are in a known state and return success whenever possible.
   From this state, normal operation can resume. If @ref nvm3_open returns an
   error, that is an indication that there is either a design or coding error,
   or that many of the NVM pages have been marked as BAD leaving unsufficient
   space in the NVM to progress. Operation may not resume if @ref nvm3_open
   returns an error.

   @note Because the @ref nvm3_open may need to do some recovery operations,
   the execution time will vary from time to time.

   @n @section nvm3_support_internal_flash Storing objects in internal FLASH
   NVM3 has support for writing and reading objects in internal i.e. memory
   mapped FLASH memory through the nvm3_hal_flash.c "driver". nvm3_hal_flash.c
   is using emlib functions to write and erase data, while it is using regular
   memory functions to read data from FLASH.

   @n The "driver" for internal flash is selected by setting the halHandle in
   the nvm3_open init struct to point to nvm3_halFlashHandle.

   @n @section nvm3_support_external_flash Storing objects in external FLASH
   MNV3 has support for writing and reading objects in external FLASH by using
   the nvm3_hal_extflash.c "driver". The nvm3_hal_extflash.c is using the Gecko
   Bootloader to read, write and erase data in the FLASH. By using this scheme,
   NVM3 does not deal with the hardware directly. All flash communication must
   be taken care of by the bootloader. As long as the bootloader has been
   configured and build for the actual hardware, supports raw reads, writes and
   erases, NVM3 should be good to go.

   @n nvm3_hal_extflash.c is using the "raw" read and write functions. It does
   not use the slot feature supported by the Gecko Bootloader.
   Be careful when configuring the bootloader memory map to avoid conflicts
   between NVM3 and other usage, including slot configuration.

   @n All data objects are encrypted using CCM encryption and counter base
   values are encrypted using AES encryption. NVM3 encryption keys are stored
   in internal FLASH. Reading the external memory alone will not give access to
   the unencrypted data or counter values.

   @n The "driver" for external flash is selected by setting the halHandle in
   the nvm3_open init struct to point to nvm3_halExtFlashHandle.

   @n @section nvm3_libraries NVM3 Libraries
   The NVM3 comes as pre-compiled libraries for Cortex M0, M3, M4 and M33
   compiled with either armgcc or iar toolchains. In addition there are verions
   with and without encryption support. The versions without encryption support
   can only be used to store data in internal FLASH, while the ones with
   encryption support can be used for both internal and external FLASH.
   Objects in internal FLASH will never be encrypted, while objects in external
   FLASH must always be encrypted.

   @n @section nvm3_example Examples

   Example 1 shows initialization, usage of data objects and repacking.

   @include nvm3_example_1.c

   Example 2 shows initialization and usage of counter objects. The
   counter object uses a compact way of storing a 32-bit counter value while minimizing
   NVM wear.

   @include nvm3_example_2.c
