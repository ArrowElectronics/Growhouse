 * @brief Properties of the application that can be accessed by the bootloader
 * @details
 *   Applications must contain an @ref ApplicationProperties_t struct declaring
 *   the application version and capabilities, etc. The metadata contained in
 *   this struct will be extracted from the application by the Simplicity
 *   Commander tool and placed in the EBL upgrade file. If such a struct is not
 *   present in the application image, it will be added to the EBL file by the
 *   Simplicity Commander.
 *
 *   The struct is also used to declare whether the application image is signed,
 *   and what type of signature is used. If no @ref ApplicationProperties_t
 *   struct is present, the bootloader will assume that the application image
 *   is signed using @ref APPLICATION_SIGNATURE_ECDSA_P256.
 *
 *   In order for the bootloader to easily locate the ApplicationProperties_t
 *   struct, if not already done by the linker, Simplicity Commander will modify
 *   word 13 of the application to insert a pointer to the
 *   ApplicationProperties_t struct.
