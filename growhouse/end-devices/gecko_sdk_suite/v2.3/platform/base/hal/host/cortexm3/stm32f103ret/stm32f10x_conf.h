 * @brief ST Microcontroller's Standard Peripherals Library inclusions and
 * definitions.
 *
 * This file is included from ST's Standard Peripherals Library and includes
 * the headers for the peripherals found in ST's Library.  It also
 * defines the assert macro used by ST's Library.  The actual documentation
 * for ST's Standard Peripherals Library is beyond the scope of Ember's
 * documentation.
 *
 * @note While this file's name, stm32f10x_conf.h, does not conform to
 * Ember's file naming convention, this file is included from ST's Standard
 * Peripherals Library.  Not renaming this file means the library does
 * not have to be modified.
 *
 * See @ref host for common documentation.
 *
 * See stm32f10x_conf.h for source code.
