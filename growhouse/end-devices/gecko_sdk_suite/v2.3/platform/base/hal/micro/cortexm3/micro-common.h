/**
 * @brief This is the core function for enabling the XTAL, biasing
 * the XTAL, checking the XTAL biasing, switching to the XTAL,
 * configuring FCLK, and configuring flash access settings.  The ultimate
 * result of calling this function until it returns true is the chip is
 * operating from the 24MHz XTAL, the XTAL is biased for lowest current
 * consumption, the CPU's FCLK is being sourced from SYSCLK, and the flash
 * is configured for optimal current consumption.
 *
 * The basic principle of this function is that it takes time for the
 * XTAL to stabilize whenever it is enabled and/or the biasing is change;
 * about 1.5ms every time the bias is changed.  This function will handle
 * the XTAL configuration, set an interrupt event to indicate when the
 * appropriate delay has elapsed, and return immediately.  This interrupt
 * event should not be monitored directly by any code other than the clock
 * module itself.  The state of the XTAL is learned by the return code
 * of this function.  As long as this function returns false, the XTAL
 * is unstable.  Calling code can perform other actions until the XTAL
 * is stable.
 *
 * The suggested use of the four XTAL API functions is as follows:
 *  - halCommonStartXtal() is called once as soon as possible to start
 *    the XTAL.  Other actions may be performed while waiting for the XTAL
 *    to stabilize.
 *  - halCommonTryToSwitchToXtal() is called repeatedly to drive
 *    the biasing and switch process.  Other actions that do not require
 *    a stable XTAL may be performed until this function returns 0.
 *  - halCommonSwitchToXtal() is called just once when a stable XTAL is
 *    required before moving on.  This function will block in the idle
 *    sleep state until the switch procedure has completed.
 *  - halCommonCheckXtalBiasTrim() is called periodically, after a switch
 *    has occurred, to check that the XTAL biasing is optimal and
 *    adjust if needed.
 *
 * halCommonTryToSwitchToXtal() function will return immediately.  This
 * function drives the switch process.  This function can be called
 * any number of times and at anytime.
 *
 * @param amBlocking true if being called in a blocking context (loop),
 * false otherwise.  Used to distinguish startup from waiting on Xtal.
 *
 * @return time, in microseconds, to delay until next bias event for crystal
 * stability.  If 0, the chip has switched to and is now using the XTAL.
 * No further bias events are in process.  If non-zero the Xtal is
 * <b>unstable<b> and the chip has not modified it's XTAL selection; it
 * remains on the same clock source (OSCHF or XTAL) and there is a bias event
 * in process.
