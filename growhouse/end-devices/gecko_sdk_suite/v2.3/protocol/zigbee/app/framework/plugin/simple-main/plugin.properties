name=Simple Main

description=This plugin provides a working main entry point into an EmberZNet application. It supplies a main() function that provides necessary initialization and main loop code for the program. Since this feature is a plugin, users can easily choose whether to use this plugin for their main() function, or to supply their own implementation. If the user does decide to write their own main() function, then this plugin can serve as a good example for main loop design.
