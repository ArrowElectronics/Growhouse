# Description of the plugin.
description=Ember implementation of the ZigBee Light Link profile enhancements to the Identify server cluster.  The plugin is only intended to assist with debugging as the implemented callbacks simply parse requests from the Identify client and blink LEDs.  Prior to production, this plugin should be replaced with code that acts on the requests in an appropriate way.
