name=Events Client
description=A plugin implementing the client-side functionality of the Smart Energy 1.2 Events cluster. The plugin is only intended to assist with debugging as the implemented callbacks simply parse responses from the Events server and print the results.  Prior to production, this plugin should be replaced with code that acts on the responses in an appropriate way.
