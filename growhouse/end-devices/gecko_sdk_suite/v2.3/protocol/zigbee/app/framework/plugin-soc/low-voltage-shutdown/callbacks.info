/** @brief Ok To Shutdown
 *

 * voltage threshold has been detected but before shutting down the chip (until
 * a full power-on reset is triggered). The application should return true if
 * the device may shutdown or false otherwise. Note that this callback is not
 * the proper place to put logic to be performed just prior to shutdown; that
 * would be the Pre Shutdown Callback. If callback returns false, shutdown
 * check will be performed again in
 * EMBER_AF_PLUGIN_LOW_VOLTAGE_SHUTDOWN_POSTPONE_DURATION_MS milliseconds.
 *
 * @param shutdownVoltage The voltage (in mV) read from VDD at shutdown time,
 * which can be used to determine the risk in doing any further activities
 * prior to shutdown. Ver.: always
