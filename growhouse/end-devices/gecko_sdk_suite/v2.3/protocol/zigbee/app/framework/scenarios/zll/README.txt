ZigBee Light Link Sample Applications

These sample applications demonstrate basic ZigBee Light Link functionality
between a light and a sleepy controller.

At startup, the light will automatically perform an energy scan in order to
find an available channel and will then form a network on that channel.  Once
it has formed a network, the light will wait for a touch link from a
controller.  Once touch linked, the light will toggle its LED in response to
on/off commands from a controller.

The controller will sleep until button 0 is pressed.  If the controller is not
joined to a network, a button press will cause the controller to wake up and
perform a touch link.  If joined, a button press will cause the controller to
wake up and broadcast an on/off command to all nodes in the network.  If the
controller has slept long enough to have aged out of its parent's child table,
the controller will automatically attempt to rejoin the network prior to
broadcasting the on/off command.  Once an action completes, the controller will
return to deep sleep.

Both the controller and the light provide feedback during touch linking by
flashing an LED and playing a tune.  A rising two-tone tune indicates a
successful operation while a falling two-tone tune indicates a failure.  A
brief tone indicates that the device has performed a long-running action and is
waiting for a result.

All application code is contained in the _callbacks.c files within each
application directory.

To use each application:

   1. Load the included application configuration file (i.e., the .isc file)
      into Simplicity Studio.

   2. Enter a new name for the application in the pop-up window.

   3. Generate the application's header and project/workspace files by
      clicking on the "Generate" button in Simplicity Studio.  The application
      files will be generated in the app/builder/<name> directory in the stack
      installation location.

   4. Load the generated project file into the appropriate compiler and build
      the project.

   5. Load the binary image onto a device using Simplicity Studio.
