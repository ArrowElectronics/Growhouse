This example program uses RTX Kernel to control 4 threads and
to pass signals between the threads. The threads in this program do
nothing more than increment counters and delay for a few clock ticks.

The RTX_EX2 example program is available for one target:

Simulator: uVision Simulator for evaluation
           - watch the variables in Watch #1 window
