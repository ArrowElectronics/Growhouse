# Description of the plugin.
description=This plugin provides a cJSON utility for host applications running on Linux. The cJSON source comes from the following git repo: https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON @ commit 3a7bd6924a67c301b8811f521de6ed07c7cf0c3c. The source included here has been modified slightly to be discrete about a cJSON_Number. This version defines cJSON_Integer and cJSON_Double creation methods to work around an issue seen on MIPs processors. This source is covered by the license included.
